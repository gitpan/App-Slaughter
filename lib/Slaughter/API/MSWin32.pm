=head1 NAME

Slaughter::API::MSWin32 - Perl Automation Tool Helper Windows implementation

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is the one that gets loaded upon Windows systems, after the generic
API implementation.  This module implements the Win32-specific primitives.

We also attempt to load C<Slaughter::API::Local::MSWin32>, where site-specific primitives
may be implemented.  If the loading of this additional module fails we report no error/warning.

        next if $name eq 'import';    # don't export this sub
        next unless *{ $symbol }{ CODE };    # export subs only

        my $imported = $caller . '::' . $name;
        *{ $imported } = \*{ $symbol };
    }

=over 8

=item Binary [mandatory]

The name of the binary file to find.

=item Path [default: $ENV{'PATH'}]

This is assumed to be a semi-colon deliminated list of directories to search
for the binary within.

=back

If the binary is found the full path will be returned, otherwise undef.

{
    my (%params) = (@_);

      $params{ 'path' } ||
      $ENV{ 'PATH' };
    my $result = undef;

    foreach my $dir ( split( /;/, $path ) )
