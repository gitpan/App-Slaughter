=head1 NAME

Slaughter::Info::generic - Perl Automation Tool Helper generic info implementation

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is the generic version of the Slaughter information-gathering
module.

Modules beneath the C<Slaughter::Info> namespace are loaded when slaughter
is executed, they are used to populate a hash with information about
the current host.

This module is loaded when no specific module matches the local system,
and is essentially a no-operation module.  A real info-module is loaded
by consulting with the value of C<$^O>, so for example we might load
C<Slaughter::Info::linux>.

Usage is:

=for example begin

     use Slaughter::Info::generic;

     my $obj  = Slaughter::Info::generic->new();
     my $data = $obj->getInformation();

=for example end

B<NOTE>: The data retrieved by this generic module is almost empty.

The only user-callable method is the C<getInformation> method which
is designed to return a hash of data about the current system.

    my ( $proto, %supplied ) = (@_);
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

    my $self = {};
    bless( $self, $class );
    return $self;

}


=head2 getInformation

This function retrieves meta-information about the current host,
and is the fall-back module which is used if a system-specific
information module cannot be loaded.

The return value is a hash-reference of data determined dynamically.

Currently the following OS-specific modules exist:

=over 8

=item C<Slaughter::Info::linux>

=item C<Slaughter::Info::MSWin32>

sub getInformation

    #
    #  The data we will return.
    #
    my $ref;

    #
    # We're unknown..?
    #
    $ref->{ 'unknown' } = "all";

    #
    # This should be portable.
    #
    $ref->{ 'path' } = $ENV{ 'PATH' };

    # return the data.
    return ($ref);
}
